  "solution": "To produce 10,000 widgets in the minimum number of days, the optimal allocation is achieved in 23 days.\n\n**Reasoning:** The combined daily output of all factories is 450 widgets. The minimum time required is therefore $\\lceil 10,000 / 450 \\rceil = 23$ days. To avoid overproduction, all three factories run for 22 days, producing $22 \\times 450 = 9,900$ widgets. On the final day (Day 23), only Factory A runs to produce the remaining 100 widgets, perfectly meeting the target.\n\n**Final Allocation:**\n| Factory | Days Operated | Total Production |\n|:--------|:--------------|:-----------------|\n| A       | 23 days       | 2,300 widgets    |\n| B       | 22 days       | 3,300 widgets    |\n| C       | 22 days       | 4,400 widgets    |\n| **Total** |      â€”        | **10,000 widgets** |"
