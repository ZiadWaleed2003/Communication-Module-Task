  "solution": "To guarantee a clear winner in an 8-team round-robin tournament, one team must achieve an unassailable lead. The minimum number of games to ensure this outcome is 7.\n\n**Reasoning:** If one team (Team A) plays and wins all 7 of its games, it secures 7 wins. Every other team, having lost to Team A, can achieve a maximum of only 6 wins. Therefore, Team A is the guaranteed winner after its 7 games are played.\n\n**Final Answer**\n$$\n\\boxed{7}\n$$"
